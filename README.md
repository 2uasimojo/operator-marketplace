# Marketplace Operator

## Project Status: pre-alpha
The project is currently pre-alpha and it is expected that breaking changes to the API will be made in the upcoming releases.

## Prerequisites
In order to deploy the Marketplace Operator, you must:
1. Have an OKD or a Kubernetes cluster with Operator Lifecycle Manager [installed](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/Documentation/install/install.md).
2. Be logged in as a user with Cluster Admin role.
   * This is a stop gap measure until the RBAC permissions are defined

## Making changes to the Marketplace Operator
The Marketplace Operator is hosted publicly at `quay.io/redhat/marketplace-operator` but not all developers have push privileges on this image. If you do not have the push privilege and are developing new features for the Marketplace Operator you must build and push your Marketplace Operator image to a registry where you have push and pull privileges and update the `deploy/operator.yaml` to pull this image. The steps below outline said process:
1. Build and push your Marketplace Operator Image with the following command.
```bash
$ export REGISTRY=<SOME_REGISTRY> \
   && export NAMESPACE=<SOME_NAMESPACE> \
   && export REPOSITORY=<SOME_REPOSITORY> \
   && export TAG=<SOME_TAG> \
   && operator-sdk build $REGISTRY/$NAMESPACE/$REPOSITORY:$TAG \
   && docker push $REGISTRY/$NAMESPACE/$REPOSITORY:$TAG
```
2. Update the `deploy/operator.yaml` to pull the Marketplace Operator image you just pushed. You should update the `spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` field with the `$REGISTRY/$NAMESPACE/$REPOSITORY:$TAG` value.

## Deploying the Marketplace Operator

### In an OKD Cluster
```bash
$ oc apply -f deploy
```

### In a Kubernetes Cluster
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deploy
```
